( R^2=1-RSS/TSS)
Graph Trendline method. ( Forecasting Model Performance

R Squared Coefficient of determination: measures how well the fitted regression line fits the data. R-squared is the proportion of variation that is explained by a linear model.

It has a value between 0 and 1; a higher R-squared means better model performance

Formula
R^2=1-RSS/TSS

RÂ² = coefficient of determination 
RSS = sum of squares of residuals
TSS = total sum of squares.

in this method, selecting the 4th-order polynomial trendline option is the closest to 1, so we are gonna take that.
